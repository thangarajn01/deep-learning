    "# LangChain\n",
    "LangChain is a versatile framework for building applications that leverage large language models (LLMs). It is designed to simplify the integration of various tools and components, making it an excellent choice for creating chatbots, complex workflows, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modular Architecture**\n",
    "    * Compose complex workflows by combining tools like models, memory, and external APIs.\n",
    "    * Easily chain tasks for multi-step processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Prompt Engineering**\n",
    "   * Use PromptTemplates for dynamic prompt creation.\n",
    "   * Supports few-shot and zero-shot learning to enhance model performance.\n",
    "   * Different formats: JSONs, YAML\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Integration**\n",
    "    * Seamlessly integrate APIs, databases, and vector stores.\n",
    "    * Enhance functionalities with external knowledge sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Management** \n",
    "    * Manage context in multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "    * Develop chatbots that remember user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-step Task Chaining**\n",
    "    * Link multiple operations in a single workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Agnosticism**    \n",
    "    * Compatible with OpenAI models, Hugging Face models, and custom LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**\n",
    "    * Combine LLMs with retrieval tools to pull context-specific information."

When the pizza finally arrived, it was lukewarm at best. A hot pizza is essential for enjoying all the flavors, and this one missed the mark right out of the gate.\\n\\nNow, onto the pizza itself. The crust was far too thick and doughy, lacking the crispy texture that makes a pizza enjoyable. The sauce was bland and didn’t provide the rich, robust flavor I anticipated. Most disappointing was the salami; it was greasy and had an overpowering taste that overshadowed any other ingredients. It felt more like a fast-food pizza than anything artisanal or homemade.\\n\\nAdditionally, the cheese was sparse, which left the whole thing feeling unbalanced and lacking that gooey, satisfying quality that great pizza usually has. \\n\\nAll in all, my experience with the Pizza Salami was far from satisfactory. I would not recommend it, and I doubt I’ll be ordering from this place again. I was really hoping for a delicious meal, but it turned out to be a regrettable choice. Hopefully, they can improve in the future, but for now, I’ll be looking elsewhere for my pizza fix.',\n",
       " 'comment': \"Thank you for sharing your detailed review! It’s always disappointing when an anticipated meal doesn't meet your expectations. Your feedback on the late delivery and the quality of the pizza itself really highlights some areas the restaurant could focus on for improvement. A good pizza experience relies heavily on not just the taste, but also the temperature and balance of flavors, so it’s unfortunate that this one missed the mark in multiple ways.\\n\\nHave you considered reaching out to the restaurant directly to express your concerns? Sometimes establishments appreciate feedback and may even offer ways to make it right. Hopefully, you find a place that delivers the delicious pizza experience you're looking for!\",\n",
